        <SUBJECT>Moodle participation is compulsory</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Some of you have not posted questions for the previous lecture.&#160; I let it go, as it was the first lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asking questions and participating in the discussions is compulsory for this course.&#160; Over and above the marks allocated for this participation, a penal action (grade reduction) may be enforced for those who do not participate.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Aakash tablets on loan for CL 692</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Every student of&#160;CL-692 will get one Aakash tablet, with lectures pre-loaded.&#160; We hope to distribute this on Wednesday between 12:30 to 13:30 and in the evening 5 to 6pm.&#160; The tablets have to be returned at the end of the semester.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Ask your questions one day before</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Dear All,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should post your questions the day before the lecture.&#160; I would want it to be completed by the midnight, when the LAN ban comes into force.&#160; For those who have access to internet, the deadline is "extended" till 6am (yes, at 6 in the morning) on the day of the lecture.&#160; Please note that there can be no extension to the extension, whatever may be the reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will ensure that you don't ask a question in the last minute, just for the sake of asking a question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will also give sufficient time for everyone to participate in the discussions, which is the main objective of this activity itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this will take care of problems, such as, Moodle not working in the last minute, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Ask your questions one day before</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I notice that Moodle was down last night also.&#160; In view of this, I give an extension: can you please post your questions ASAP?&#160; Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Ask your questions one day before</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;When you post your question, can you please change your subject to slide number?&#160; For example, you can say something like, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slide 3: Tustin Approximation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will help organise the discussion better.&#160; It will also help understand the questions better.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Proxy settings for Aakash app </SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Dear Sir &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed after the class, I am posting my question here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is option for setting proxy settings for browser, and hence I am able to access internet using browser. But there is no option for setting proxy settings for apps and hence no app is able to access wifi and are not running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you please post the solution for this problem&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

I will suggest two solutions. Download this opensource app&lt;br /&gt;ProxyDroid from here &amp;lt;http://www.appszoom.com/android_applications/communication/proxydroid_xtmc_download.html&amp;gt; and try your luck. There many such proxy authentication apps on Google play too, to try those you should connect to some direct internet source using 3G/2G dongle or wifi hotspot from any compatible phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second solution is bit complex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a GNU/Linux machine(assuming its IP to be 192.168.1.2) install squid3 proxy server(say on your laptop)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then open */etc/squid3/squid.conf* file as sudo and add these lines at the end of the file after updating *username:password *field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*http_port hostmachine-ip:3128&lt;br /&gt;cache_peer netmon.iitb.ac.in &amp;lt;http://netmon.iitb.ac.in&amp;gt; parent 80 0 no-query default login=/username:password/&lt;br /&gt;# No direct access&lt;br /&gt;never_direct allow all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Save and close the above file. Restart the squid3 sever by&lt;br /&gt;*sudo service squid3 restart*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now connect your aakash to a wifi, long press on connected wifi and select *modify network, *Then enable *Show advance options* *-&amp;gt; Proxy settings (select manual)&lt;br /&gt;*Add your squid3 server's detail here&lt;br /&gt;*Proxy hostname *192.168.1.2&lt;br /&gt;*Proxy port *3128&lt;br /&gt;*Bypass proxy for *iitb.ac.in &amp;lt;http://iitb.ac.in&amp;gt;, 127.0.0.1, localhost&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (*.iitb.ac.in &amp;lt;http://iitb.ac.in&amp;gt; will not work)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then add your static IP/Gateway/DNS as usual, and for&lt;br /&gt;*Network prefix* give 16 (if your subnet mask is 255.255.0.0, if not sure search your value from net)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save settings, disable and enable wifi to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;Your gmail may not work properly but this will set internet system wide. The only disadvantage is you need to engage a machine to use this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Srikant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Proxy settings for Aakash app </SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I may, I would like to point out that many of the users have special characters in their username/password. For them a small hack is to use URL escape characters in their settings. i.e. when configuring this line :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;cache_peer netmon.iitb.ac.in &amp;lt;http://netmon.iitb.ac.in&amp;gt; parent 80 0 no-query default login=/username:password/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;suppose username is &lt;strong&gt;arka&lt;/strong&gt; and password is &lt;strong&gt;@rk@&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;then the config line would be:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;cache_peer netmon.iitb.ac.in &amp;lt;http://netmon.iitb.ac.in&amp;gt; parent 80 0 no-query default login=/arka:%40rk%40/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;For a comprehensive list of URL escape characters one could refer to:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Re: Lecture on Monday - Lab 1</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;sir, scilab seems to have &#160;limited functions for handling control system problems. many times computer hangs , the error messages are also not displayed . can we switch to matlab?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Lecture on Monday - Lab 1</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Absolutely not.&#160; Your observation about Scilab is totally incorrect.&#160; Do you know that that all the calculations required to launch the Arianne rockets have been done using Scilab?&#160; If Arianne rockets that have placed many of our satellites are based on Scilab, it is sufficiently good enough for us.&lt;br /&gt;We will see if we can give a link to my talk that explains why we should NOT use Matlab.&#160; You shall use only Scilab in this course.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Lecture on Monday - Lab 1</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Not able to resolv &#160;code dependencies. For example, &#160;the executing the code 'ball_basic.sce' as mentioned in 'DigitalControl' book gives the error 'sort - undefined'&#160;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Lecture on Monday - Lab 1</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Please use gsort() as sort() is obsolete in higher versions of scilab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also note, for gsort() the default way of arranging is by decreasing order of magnitude. Please refer to scilab help for more info.&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Re: First Lab</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Dear students,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a slight mistake in the "order_1.sci" file. The "costf_2" was supposed to be "costf_1". Attaching the corrected file. Kindly replace the incorrect file with the one attached.&lt;/p&gt;

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Is there a change in the lab assignment deadline ?.&#160; It was mentioned in the last class that, assignment submission can be rescheduled considering&#160; mid sem exams.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: First Lab</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Yes, as I announced in the class, the deadline is shifted to Tuesday, 26 Feb. 2013 at 11:55 PM (i.e., midnight).&#160; You are urged to complete your experiments, Scilab based problem solving, etc., well ahead of time and to submit by this deadline.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping the uncertainties in Internet, connectivity, Moodle, etc., there is also a one day "EXTENSION", so that the extended deadline is Wednesday, 27 Feb. 2013 at 11:55 PM (i.e., midnight).&#160; Please note that the submission time will not be futher extended for ANY reason.&#160; This is a hard deadline.&#160; There can be no extension on extension!&#160; In order that you do not get stuck with the problem of Moodle/Internet failing in the last minute, please upload at least one working version well before the deadline and keep improving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submissions have to be made only through Moodle.&#160; Files sent to email addresses will NOT be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also make a note of our departmental policy: FR grade to be given to people who use unfair means in assignments, labs, projects, quiz, and, of course, exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that Matlab based solution is not acceptable and will result in zero marks.&#160; If anyone needs help with Scilab training, please let us know and we can make arrangements.&#160; The deadlines will not be changed because of this, however.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;We do not want you to upload your code on the forum as it becomes available for all other students. You may unkowingly get involved in malpractices like copy cases etc. We do not encourage to share your files with others.&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Discussion on Mid Semester Exam</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Some students told me that they solved 1(a) of the first problem by step response approximation and then wrote an one line answer each for 1(b) and 1(c) saying that the answer will be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the class, the discussion on this topic ended inconclusively.&#160; I told you that we need to look for a reference that will "prove" that statement.&#160; I also mentioned that it would be worthwhile checking this statement with some more examples.&#160; Finally, in the exam paper, I had assigned 16 marks for 1(b) and 1(c) together - please don't expect me to assign 16 marks for one line statement.&#160; Also, I had mentioned that we would provide help for those who wanted to calculate exponential of a matrix.&#160; Please note that if there is a method to avoid a particular difficult calculation, I will not offer that help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that at least some of you solved 1b and 1c.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Discussion on Mid Semester Exam</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The same students mentioned that as they expected the paper to be conceptual and short (as I mentioned in the class), they thought that a one line answer was sufficient for 1b and 1c.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I want to comment on the length of an open book exam.&#160; The length of an open book will necessarily have to be different from that of a closed book exam.&#160; Otherwise, there is a risk of some students not studying for the exam at all, hoping that they can "figure out" during the exam time.&#160; Any amount of time provided for such students will be insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;In this method are we going to cancel the effect of noise on output (assuming that output depends on past values of noise signal, say 10 samples- degree of C polynomial is 10, and there is delay of 5 samples in input output relation-k=-10) , by taking suitable control action?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this method works only if the delay (K) is less than the degree of the C polynomial. What is your opinion?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;The SBHS vlabs site is up and all the devices are working properly. The SBHS no. 5 was faulty and is replaced with a new board. Students using SBHS no. 5 are requested to repeat the step test experiment in case if they have already done. The deadline will be anounced soon.

&lt;p&gt;The submission deadline for Second lab is 10 April, 2013 and you are expected to submit the second lab results by this date. There is a two days extension for this submission deadline. The extention deadline for second lab is 12 April, 2013. This deadline will not be further extended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For submission, only the PartB submission link is active till 12 April. You can submit both Part A as well as Part B here. However, this link will take only one file. Hence, make sure you put both your PartA and Part B submissions in a folder, rename it with your vlabs username, zip/rar this folder and submit. This way, your submission will contain two separate folders PartA and PartB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any queries regarding second lab submissions then reply to this post.&lt;/p&gt;

        <MESSAGE>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation on SBHS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Based on the data collected in Part 1, I modelled the system and created a pole placement controller. Simulation of the controller on the transfer function with Xcos works correctly. But, I am not able to apply the controller on SBHS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approach: I modified the &lt;span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"&gt;steptest.sci&lt;/span&gt; file. The function &lt;span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"&gt;steptest&lt;/span&gt; now returns the temperature along with other variables. I feed the temperature back in the loop to the controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem: The function &lt;span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"&gt;steptest &lt;/span&gt;is showing errors "algebraic loop" when I put it with same clock as the controller. When I delay the controller by 1 second, the function does not give any output.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Second Lab Doubts</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Hello Amol,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Algedric loop error occurs because the feedback has no delay factor and hence is expected at the input instantenously. This error can be avoided by adding a very small delay factor in the feedback loop (explore the palette browser of Xcos to get the delay block). The inroduction of this delay factor may however affect the performance and one should be aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other way of clossing the loop is by directly writing the control law in the steptest.sci file. This is the easiest approach since you already have the heat, fan and temperature variables available.&lt;/p&gt;

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;dear sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't get the concept of 'D' the time delay in the u(t) (disturbance variable) as mentioned in the equation d(x(t))/dt= F*x(t)+G*u(t-D).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what i understood from the video is that this is the propagation time delay between the u(t) and state variable x(t). if above is correct then as per my understanding, this propagation time will be different for the different input and state variable pair (combination). hence D should be different for all the states and input pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;please clarify.&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Re: Q&amp;A for lecture 2</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand this is to consider a system that has only a delay associated with it.&#160; In other words, what is sent in will come out $$D$$ time units after.&#160; Thus, we have $$y(t) = u(t-D)$$, where, $$y$$ and $$u$$ are output and input, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Q&amp;A for lecture 2</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to imagine a noncausal system.&#160; But this is possible when space is the independent variable, as opposed to time being independent.&#160; In this case, future value will actually refer to a value that is ahead in position.&#160; This idea is useful to explain some concepts also.&#160; For example, in Shannon's reconstruction theorem (which we will see in the near future), we will see that the formula is noncausal.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;1. Why are we not considering disturbance variables in the discretization discussed for a ZOH signal? Can we treat them in the same way mathematically as the manipulated variables?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. If we use a linear or a polynomial function (such as Lagrange interpolation) to describe the discretized data, will that provide a better plant model than a zero order hold description? Or is this contrary to the approach that is being discussed in this course?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For systems with delay, if D &amp;gt; Ts (say Ts &amp;lt; D &amp;lt; 2Ts), will the system depend only on u(n-2) and u(n-1). If that is the case, will B in the original equation be zero?&lt;/p&gt;

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I thought that this was explained in the lecture.&#160; It is also explained in equations 2.49 to 2.50 in the textbook.&#160; Please go through the video again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What step of my explanation did you not understand?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Q&amp;A for lecture 2</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, that is how we will deal with the disturbance variables also.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you say is more correct: these methods are more accurate, but also involve a lot of work.&#160; Because of ease, a lot of people use ZOH.&#160; We now have lots of people who offer solutions around this method; we have a lot of theoretical results, etc.&#160; Moreover, if the accuracy is not sufficient, we can always use a larger sampling.&#160; Other hold methods will now be acceptable, only if they show extraordinary (say, 10 times or more) advantages over ZOH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Q&amp;A for lecture 2</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;How do we know the value that has not yet come - presumably, it will depend on the measurement that is yet to be made.&#160; This will be an acausal approach.&#160; What is possible is to extrapolate the previous two data points, which is a first order hold.&#160; But as I have replied to Baraskar earlier, it is not so popular as the ZOH.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I was reading about non-linear controls and there I found lyapunov control which is often used for non linear models as per wikipedia.

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;In the Example: Convolution, we have already ignored the terms where 1(n-k) is zero. Now, for the limit 0 to n, n-k is always &amp;gt;=0 (assumption: n&amp;gt;=0). So, would it be wrong to ignore 1(n) in the final expression as it is always equal to.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;while doing manipulations for calculating inverse transform, we are multiplying/dividing by z. please clarify what will happen to ROC of the transform by doing this. will it affect ROC? what care one should take while doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn't clear as to what is meant by a causal signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;u(k) should be zero for k&amp;lt;0 but doesnt the value of k totally depend on the reference time assumed for the entire system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case how is a causal signal defined.&lt;/p&gt;

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;No, it is not obvious.&#160; For example, what if g(n) has had nonzero terms for negative argument?&#160;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: 21 Jan. 2013 - 3: Z-Transform</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;One should keep track of the ROC, at least mentally.&#160; ROC is the region where the Z-transform converges.&#160; As a result, different terms of a partial fraction can have different ROCs.&#160; For example, see Example 4.29 in the book, page 99.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: 21 Jan. 2013 - 3: Z-Transform</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The phrase "causal signal" is not rigorously defined as a "causal system".&#160; In fact, this phrase is introduced mainly for convenience.&#160; Of course, if you view it as the output of a causal system, then it makes more sense.&#160; Instead of using some k, please use the "current" time - in this case the problems you have raised do not arise.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;When we say that 'convolution is associative' we are not really proving it to be so..we are just saying that the order of the brackets does not matter. One can prove it mathematically, but is there an intuitive way to grasp the fact without resorting to equations?&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Re: 21 Jan. 2013 - 3: Z-Transform</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Intutively we can feel this, as we always do in a control course.&#160; In fact, we take it for granted as well.&#160; What is required is the rigorous mathematical derivation.&#160; This derivation is available in most basic signal processing books.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: 21 Jan. 2013 - 3: Z-Transform</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;In my view, the main difference between system at rest and system at steady state is that one do not have driving force (excitation signals) and other has driving force.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: 21 Jan. 2013 - 3: Z-Transform</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;All systems at rest are also in steady state but not vice verse. System at rest means there is/are no input(s).&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Re: 21 Jan. 2013 - 3: Z-Transform</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;If we have/design a system which needs the input sample at a later sampling instant (to calculate the output at the current instant), then that system becomes non - causal. (i.e., it depends on future inputs). e.g., y(n) = u(n+1). As you have suggested, such systems will never get future inputs at the given instant and cannot be realised in practise. This is the reason why a controller design should be done carefully to produce only causal systems/designs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in an another post, we do not work with non causal systems in control applications.&#160; If the independent variable is length - this happens in image processing applications - then we may use the information ahead of us (in position) and behind us to reconstruct the information in the current location.&#160; The same interpolation noncausal formula may be used effectively.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Past input refers to what inputs already occurred and future input refers to the yet to be applied inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Causal system is one that responds "after" an input is applied.&#160; This is what we deal with in real life systems, especially in control applications.&#160; So your question could have been, "what is the need for a noncausal system?", as these respond even before an input is applied.&#160; I have already answered this question as a reply to Patel Pranavkumar's post.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;These concepts are very similar whether you are dealing with difference equations or with differential equations.&#160; You may refer to DSP by Proakis and Manolakis or Signals and Systems by Openheim, Wilsky and Young.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;While continuous time signals with different frequencies are different, discretised signals separated by 2&#960; are identical. So in this case, wouldn't the information we get by discretizing a continuous signal be rather misleading?&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Re: 24 Jan. 2013 - 4: Inv. Z-Transform and Frequency Response</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The reason is the restriction on the choice of z in Fourier Transform.&#160; In Z-transform, there is no restriction on z.&#160; In Fourier transform, however, we restrict it to unit circle.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Re: 24 Jan. 2013 - 4: Inv. Z-Transform and Frequency Response</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I guess that this has to do with the type of signal that is being sampled.&#160; Suppose that the signal under consideration is completely random and that we know nothing about it.&#160; Then we have no option but to sample at a very high rate.&#160; Then, it does not matter how you sample, random sampling may do.&#160; But if you know something about the signal and you want to minimise the sampling rate, you would want to use some logic - random sampling does not seem to be the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: 24 Jan. 2013 - 4: Inv. Z-Transform and Frequency Response</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Chronologically, what you say is correct.&#160; Using the maximum value of F, we decide Fs.&#160; On the other hand, when we do a thought experiment, we can do the opposite.&#160; This helps discuss the following issue: Given a nominal value of F, Fs is selected and fixed.&#160; If now F changes, how it will affect the sampling process?&#160; A similar kind of procedure will be followed in control system design also.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: 24 Jan. 2013 - 4: Inv. Z-Transform and Frequency Response</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;This is a symmetric choice.&#160; Moreover, as shown in Slide 31, using the properties of odd and even functions, we need to carry out the calculations for only half the $$\omega$$ values.&#160; This cannot be done if you use arbitrary domain.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: 24 Jan. 2013 - 4: Inv. Z-Transform and Frequency Response</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;You will first have to divide the numerator by the denominator and bring it to the form $$K + \frac {B(z)}{A(z)}$$, with the fraction being strictly proper.&#160; One can then apply the partial fraction expansion techniques to the second term, B/A.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Re: 24 Jan. 2013 - 4: Inv. Z-Transform and Frequency Response</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;It depends on ROC.&#160; If the ROC is the same for both $$U_1$$ and $$U_2$$, then the implication you have suggested is true.&#160; But if the ROCs are different, the time domain signals can be different, even if their Z-transforms are identical.&#160; This is explained in Section 4.1.2 of the book, the tile of the section being "Absolute Convergence".&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: 24 Jan. 2013 - 4: Inv. Z-Transform and Frequency Response</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Yes, if we don't sample fast enough, we will indeed get into trouble.&#160; But on the other hand, if we sample fast enough, we are ok.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with discrete time fourier transform, we get a function in frequency domain which is periodic over frequency and causes aliasing problem if sampling rate is less than FMax/2. and if i have understood correctly, its special case of&#160; Z transform ( z= e(jw)). we know that Z transform is not periodic except for this ( z= e(jw) and may be some other similar values). so is it one of the reasons for development of Z transforms?&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Re: 24 Jan. 2013 - 4: Inv. Z-Transform and Frequency Response</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;This can be explained for any $$\omega$$ value in the range of 0 to $$2\pi$$.&#160; Although in slide 19, we said that $$\omega_0&amp;gt;\pi$$, we never used these values.&#160; The results are true for any $$2\pi&amp;gt;\omega_0&amp;gt;0$$.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Re: 24 Jan. 2013 - 4: Inv. Z-Transform and Frequency Response</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;No that is not the main reason for the development of Z-transform.&#160; Fourier transform is defined only for bounded signals.&#160; This restriction is not there in case of Z-transforms.&#160; This is important because we have to deal with unbounded signals also in control applications.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Because Fourier transform is restricted to unit circle, it helps provide frequency dependent information.&#160; The concepts of filtering, etc., can be explained easily in the frequency domain, i.e., after taking Fourier transform.&#160; In order to explain the important concept of frequency response, you need Fourier transform.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Let me try to answer in a different way.&#160; Suppose you subject a transfer function H(z) to a random signal $$\xi$$ and call the output $$v$$.&#160; Suppose that we consider the output $$v$$ also to be a random signal.&#160; Should we, as a result, call H(z) as something different from a transfer function?&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, we assume that the disturbance is also defined by a transfer function and try to fit it with experimental data.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Re: Identification: please post your questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;It is a two step process.&#160; First find G and attribute the difference to v(n).&#160; Then describe v(n) as a filtered white noise.&#160; Through this, obtain H.&#160; Finally, with G and H as the initial values, do a fitting once again.&#160; This is explained in the book, chapter 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This process makes the identification easier.&#160; It is almost like our approach to solve nonlinear equations: first come up with an initial guess; using this as the starting point, arrive at the final solution.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Identification: please post your questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Yes, v(n) is not white noise.&#160; It is the difference between the actual measurement and G(z)u(n).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, ergodicity allows us to get an idea of all &lt;em&gt;realisations &lt;/em&gt;through what actually happens in time, sequentially.&#160; The second one actually happens and we can measure them.&#160; On the other hand, all the realisations actually don't happen and we can only hypothesize about them.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;We choose our input signals such that the matrix turns out to be singular. However I don't know if there is a definite way to ensure such a choice of input signal without knowing the system except for trial and error, which is my doubt as asked above.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Why regression in AR? (Slide 16)</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the ARMA model, what is the motivation in defining regression of the previous outputs and averaging of the previous inputs for prediction of a random series?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand it is just a model, but why regression?&lt;/p&gt;

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Why it is said that in frequency domain design method ( nyquist analysis) the dependence on the model is not as stringent as in any other control system design and analysis methods ?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Nyquist plot questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Other types of models (e.g. pole, zero model) are possibly more sensitive to perturbations.&#160; For example, if we perturb the frequency information a little bit, the behaviour may not change much.&#160; On the other hand, if we perturb the pole or zero a little bit, the behaviour can change dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;Why do we need the zeros of the rational function 1 + Ka(z)/b(z) 'inside' the unit circle? Why can't it be on the unit circle and still be stable, since magnitude runaway won't happen anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the stability criterion C2 contour should encircle origin P times that is equal to the number of open loop unstable poles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say we have the Kb(z)/a(z) open loop transfer function and while calculating the unstable poles should infinity be taken into account ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the analog control course while calculating open loop and closed loop poles I don't think we ever took infinity into account.&lt;/p&gt;

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;If 1 zero of the characteristic equation is on the unit circle, then it is marginally stable. However, if more than 1 zero of the characteristic equation is on the unit circle, it is unstable.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Nyquist plot questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The poles at infinity should not be taken into account. I guess they were considered here for ease in derivation.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Nyquist plot questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Many approximations are made while arriving at the transfer function of any plant.&#160; These approximations could have a bearing on the performance of the control system and in fact, the stability itself.&#160; One way to account for these is through gain and phase margins.&#160; We insist that these should be large enough to account for plant variations.&#160; We refer to this as the unmodelled gains and delays.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Nyquist plot questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;You should work with the one point that is closest to (-1,0).&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Nyquist plot questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;1. Open loop gain refers to the gain of the plant alone - this is $$G(z)$$ - this is the methodology I follow - this is what we will use in this course.&#160; If the control system with a transfer function $$G_c(z)$$ is already present, some also refer to $$G(z)G_c(z)$$ as the open loop gain - but I will not use this nomenclature.&#160; To arrive at the closed loop gain, one has to close the feedback loop first.&#160; The closed loop gain is the transfer function between the external input (say, reference or disturbance signals) and the output of the plant.&#160; It is of the form $$\dfrac{G_c(z)G(z)}{1+G_c(z)G(z)}$$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.&#160; Using Nyquist plot, it is easier to explain the stability of systems, compared to Bode plots.&#160; Nyquist and Bode plots can be built using experimental data alone - this cannot be done in other methods, for example, root-locus method, which relies on pole-zero information, which in turn is not available through experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Nyquist plot questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;It has to be a linear time invariant system.&#160; I cannot think of any other constraint.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Nyquist plot questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;One will first run the controller in open loop mode.&#160; That is, one will set the manipulated variables, such as, cooling rate, motor speed, etc., manually.&#160; Once the logic is established and verified to be working, the loop is closed.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to point out that one carries out simulation before doing anything to the plant directly.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Nyquist plot questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The directions of C1 and C3 have to be consistent, that's all.&#160; If C1 is measured in the clockwise direction, you should count C2 (and hence, C3 and C4) also in the clockwise direction.&#160; You may also use counterclockwise measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only a sign change between the two.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Nyquist plot questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;At infinity, we may have zeros, but not poles.&#160; Only when the numerator transfer function is of greater degree than the denominator, we will have this situtaiton.&#160; We know that this cannot happen for causal systems.&#160; We will not deal with anything other than causal plants!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this observation, we will never have to worry about unstable poles at infinity.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;for stability we say, all poles of a transfer function should be inside unity circle in z plane. but if a pole is on z=1, as in our example, it is also stable, as we asserted in the problem G(z) = 1/z(z-1). if it is the case, why we do not say that for stability all poles should lie on or inside unity cirle.&lt;/p&gt;

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of Laplace TF, we wanted the resulting CLTF to not have poles in RHP, because their inverse would give us a exp(+ve real part) which wud diverge as t becomes infinity....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are the stability for Z-transform TF the way they are? We are concerned only with the co-efficients not the value of the Z-function...&lt;br /&gt;The series shouldnt diverge, thats ok; but what about the CL output signal? Roots and poles of Z should have nothing to do wiht that....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please clarify&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Internal Model Principle</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;In the first few slides , design of controller for unbounded r(n) and v(n) are explained. The following questions are related to this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.Generally control system design is targeted for closed loop BIBO stability with internal stability (no cancellation unstable poles).&#160; Why do we require bounded output for an unbounded input or disturbance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.Will this approach affect the tracking performance of the control system (step and ramp inputs are common &#8211; and are not bounded)? Could you please explain a little more detailed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.&lt;span style="line-height: 1.4;"&gt;The controller designed with this theory is applicable for a particular type of functions (r(n) and v(n)) only. &#160;Is it always possible to predict the nature of input (r(n)) and v(n)?.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.4;"&gt;4.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.4;"&gt;&#160;Suppose that &#945;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;r &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.4;"&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&#160;&#160;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.4;"&gt;&#945;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;v&#160; &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.4;"&gt;different&#160; and this situation results in &#945;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;v&#160; &#160;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.4;"&gt;in the &#160;numerator of the closed loop transfer function and makes zeros outside unit cirlce. What are the effect of these zeros &#160;on the closed loop output response y(n) to a tracking command&#160; - r(n)?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.4;"&gt;5.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.4;"&gt;Gc(z) in the given form results in a unstable(stand alone) controller and makes the loop transfer function unstable even if the open loop plant is stable.&#160; This can create issues if there is physical break in the feedback signal(sensor failure , wire cut etc) .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.4;"&gt;6.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.4;"&gt;Is this just a theoretical method of synthesizing controller? Can it be used for controlling practical systems?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Internal stability</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have an unstable plant transfer function lets say G(z) as z/(z-1.5). this plant is closed with Gc =1 to make it stable. r is set point, e is error = r-y, where y is output of the plant. by solving this we get y/r = G/(1+G)= z/(2*z-1.5). this gives me bounded output for bounded input. i also have e/r = 1/(1+G)= (z-1.5)/(2*z-1.5)= Gm(z) (lets say), this is stable too. so it fulfills internal stability criterion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now if I say, r is input and e is internal variable to my closed loop system and y is output of the closed loop system. my system can be represented as open loop system with r as input to Gm(z) cascaded with G(z) and e as output of Gm(z) and input to G(z), y as final output to G(z). this seems to me as same system with all internal variables stable. but curiously, we have unstable pole&#160; and zero cancelation between Gm(z) and G(z) here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i also observed that this similarity evaporates if i add some noise at e (which is at input to my plant G(z)) in both these equivalent models. the original feedback model is still stable where as output of my open loop equivalent (as mentioned above) will be unstable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#160;is it right, sir? please comment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Open loop instability</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;In the concept of internal stability, when we are talking about unstable pole-zero cancellations, we can observe that the open-loop transfer funtion of the plant is unstable [Eg. G(z)=1/(z+2)]. What is its relevance in the practical scenario? Do we actually have plants which are open-loop unstable? Can you please give me an example?&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>What if input signals are unbounded?</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For internal stability and the unstable pole zero cancellation the inputs R1 and R2 have been taken to be stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what if R1 and R2 are unbounded and the transfer functions are able to nullify the unstable pole effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in that case the error signals might be stable. can you please clarify as to what is the state of the system in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we have more than one plant (say two plants, and disturbances can be introduced at either input, or other such complicated cases), can this analysis be extended to such a general case? Can a similar matrix of transfer functions be determined in such a case to determine internal stability? Or do we need other non-linear methods to address such systems?&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Can pole-zero cancellation be avoided by design?</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Most of the systems are nonlinear and we don't have their exact plant models. We work with most accurate models and linearize them about an operating point. So our plant transfer function G(z) is an approximation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So shouldn't there be some tolerance level when we are designing Gc(z) so that pole-zero calcellation doesn't happen in reality?&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Yes! In that case, A matrix of x(k+1)=Ax(k)+bu(k) will not go to infinity as k&#8594;&#8734;, so y(k) will be bounded.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Unbounded intermediate signals</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir, we worked out that cancellation in the system with no intermediate signals will also lead to unbounded signals, is it just because the initial non-zero signals amplify with time and make it unbounded ? delay of 1 Ts between controller and output is okay. But from there I didnt understand why would it create any problems, You mentioned that the controller was not realisable, why is that so? Please clarify...&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;lowpass filter limits the spectrem of the signal to the cut off frequency. so we can say that the frequency spectrum of the signal is bounded, but the power levels at the pass band frequencies are still unbounded and makes the signal unbounded.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;with ref. to slide no. 6, &#160;In servo problem we keep V=0 but how will the system respond if we consider V as some disturbance while tracking set point R ?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal stability</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;system's output is stable provided no zero-pole cancellation is applied then it is called internaly stable. Does this statement has any excepetion as we have exception when system is marginally stable and the step response makes it unstable?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;1.&#160; We would want the difference between the reference signal and the actual output to be small, even for an unbounded reference signal.&#160; The reference signal could be a step or ramp, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.&#160; No, it will not affect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.&#160; If v(n) and r(n) are bounded signals, we need not know the exact nature.&#160; But if it is an unbounded signal, we need to know it exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. A zero outside the unit circle gives rise to a nonminimum phase response.&#160; This results in reduced performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.&#160; Yes, it is a terrible thing to use an unstable controller with an open loop stable plant, even if the closed loop system is stable.&#160; What you have suggested is worse - you say that the closed loop system is unstable - it is not at all acceptable.&#160; Why would you want to destabilise a stable system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.&#160; We will use these theories to design controllers for practical systems.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;What you are saying is equivalent to $$\dfrac 1{1+G}\times G$$.&#160; In this case, the unstable roots are identical - they come from the same G.&#160; This cancellation is perfectly ok.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Delay modeling</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Most of the real time systems have a some responce time that creates the time lag between input and output. When Y(0),-----,Y(N) (desired outputs of system) are known, we can design a controller to account that delay. What if the Y() series is unknown and it is dependent on realtime conditions (such as tracking or servo control)? Is there a way or method to design control which can react with realtime responces while the system delay is significant?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Inverted pendulum is an example.&#160; It will fall down if no control is applied.&#160; A bicycle is an unstable system.&#160; If it is not driven, it will fall.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The notion of stability that we use is in the sense of bounded input, bounded output.&#160; With respect to tracking and disturbance rejection, we allow the exogeneous signals, i.e., v(n) and r(n) to be unbounded, so long as we know the exact nature.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;This analysis is indeed possible for a multivariable system.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;For studying Internal model stability we studied it using laplace transform and in this course we are studying IMC using Z tranform. Can&#160; both the approaches be used interchangibly or z transform has some advantage over laplace transform.&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;This is indeed the topic in robust control.&#160; In these methods, one often calculates the controller recursively, solving a "known" problem at every step.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;In this lecture, we are taking v to be deterministic.&#160; If it is not deterministic, we will follow the methods presented in the previous lecture.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Yes, even if there are imperfections in the pole zero cancellation, the response will reach the correct values at least for large time values.&#160; In view of this we can say that the cancelled system is more or less similar to the uncancelled system.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Can you please give me the context - e.g., which slide?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;What I mean is that because we forbid unstable pole zero cancellation, realisability is not an issue in discrete time systems.&#160; We don't have such an elegant mechanism in continuous time systems.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The principles that work on both Z and Laplace transforms are known as algebraic.&#160; While Laplace transforms are easier to understand, Z-transforms are easier to implement.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;As far as i know there is no such real or practicle system exist. It we designed a controller in which we did unstable pole-zero calculation by using &#160;mathematical equations we can show that no of zeros will exceed the no of poles which in practice can not exist.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;External behavior of the system is different, assume a third order plant and dominant pole is cancelled by a controller zero, the input / output behavior of the combined system will be like a second order system.

&lt;p&gt;While discussing 'the diagonalization of the square matrix' you have taken the y(k) to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;y(k) = (3/2)&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;[(-0.5)&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;(-2)&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;[...]+...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir, I wanted to know why in all the cases you have used&#160;(-0.5)&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;(-2)&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;. Can we not simplify this to 1&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; i.e., 1 ??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, sir I did not quite understand what were the "hidden modes" that you spoke of during 'diagonalization of the square matrix'??&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Controller unstable?</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By having /alpha in the denominator of controller G_c(z), we are making the controller unstable, which can make the input signal, u(n), to the plant unstable. How is this problem sorted out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="edited"&gt;(Edited by &lt;a href="http://moodle.iitb.ac.in/user/view.php?id=15477&amp;amp;course=1622"&gt;RAHUL PRAKASH&lt;/a&gt; - original submission Monday, 4 February 2013, 2:54 AM)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>V stochastic or deterministic?</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;While developing the internal model principle, you say that V should be stable. We can't solve the problem for unstable V. We are solving the problem where first we model a random disturbance and then impose a condition of stability on it. 1)How can I be assured that we are not severly limiting the system? 2)What are implications of unstable v?&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Presence of alpha in transfer functions</SUBJECT>

&lt;p&gt;The numerator of the transfer function between Y(Z) and V(Z) (regulation), as well as of the transfer function between E(z) and R(Z)(tracking), contains \alpha. All the components of \alpha in each of the transfer function may not be cancelled. This leads to a non-minimum phase system. Will this have any undue effects on the system? if so, how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the assumption that B and&#160;&#945; do not have a common factor justified, since its the controller transfer function that we can control and not the plant transfer function? If B does have a common factor, how do we go about modelling the controller?&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Practical Problems in case of intermediate unbounded signals</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir, In practical sense, why do we need to bother about internal stability at all if our output is stable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have talked about saturation/overflow/explosion in the slides but please explain it in context of an unbounded signal from the controller to the plant, the final output being stable.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Delay modeling</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Your question is not clear.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the desired response is known to the person who operates it, we could call them the domain specialist or expert.&#160; If they want to change the desired response with time, say, depending on plant conditions, it is very much possible.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;What do you mean by bounding the unbounded signals?&#160; By this, do you mean the stabilisation of unbounded "systems"?&#160;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Yes.&#160; We need the concepts of poles and zeros of MIMO systems, defined by matrices of transfer functions.&#160; Smith McMillan form brings out the pole zero structure of MIMO systems.&#160; A good reference on this topic is Thomas Kailath, Linear Systems.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;If these common terms have zeros inside the unit circle, there is no problem.&#160; If these common terms are outside the unit circle, then it is forbidden.&#160; Of course, we do talk about the cancellation of terms of the form $$(z-1)^n$$.&#160; Here, we assume that we know these terms "exactly".&#160; This topic is explained in the book.&#160; We don't normally work with signals whose poles lie "outside" i.e., z&amp;gt;1, the unit circle.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Your question is not clear.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;It is possible to make the digital controller almost identical to the analog controller through very high sampling rate.&#160; At the same time, it is possible to design the digital controller quite different from its analog version by improper approximation.&#160; In this case, we can certainly destabilise the system under focus.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I guess that you are talking about slide 17.&#160; What you are talking about is a 1x2 matrix and not a product.&#160; As a result, the simplification of the form you have in mind is not at all possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should compare the results of slide 17 with that of slide 13.&#160; The $$-2$$ term, which creates all difficulties, is missing in slide 13.&#160; This is the missing mode.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I multiiplied the two transfer functions and cancelled the common factor.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Although the controller by itself may be unstable, its output, namely u, need not be unstable.&#160; You have to look at the closed loop transfer function between the reference signal r and the controller output u.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;What I mean is that if V is unbounded, we should know it "exactly".&#160; If V is bounded, we need not know its exact nature.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The nonminimum phase results in performance deterioration.&#160; We may not be able to eliminate this effect.&#160; This topic is discussed in detail in Chapter 9 of the book.&#160; We will soon get to it in the class also.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;If B already has the factor $$\alpha$$, we need not include it in the controller $$G_c$$.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;If we allow unstable pole-zero cancellation, some loop signals can grow unbounded, even if the output is perfectly bounded.&#160; These unbounded signals can exceed the allowable limits and hence can result in a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Can signals have poles, zeros?</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir, what exactly does V denote?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it's the transfer function, then instead of V, shouldn't we write d.V in the equation; d being the disturbance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if it's a transfer function, how can we talk of it having unstable "poles"?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While discussing internal model principle, &#160;we are saying unbounded disturbances can be handled by the controller provided their pole positions are known. But if their pole positions are known, can they be pre - processed to make them bounded before entering the control loop?&#160;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Internal model, stability questions</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Yes, it may be possible.&#160; But this could imply changing the process itself.&#160; If the plant is made to behave better based on the domain related considerations, it will be much better.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;In the case of small fall time the bound is taken on omega but for small undershoot bound on rho is taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you explain why&lt;/p&gt;

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The desired response considered is of order 2. If the plant is higher order this will result cancellation of some of the poles of the plant by the controller. This is fine as far as the cancelled poles are stable. How to proceed if there is an unstable pole zero cancelation?&lt;/p&gt;

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;1.&#160; D, N and C arise in practical problems.&#160; We will see examplese of these in Chapter 9 of the book.&#160; Advanced examples of this are given in Chapter 13 of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.&#160; There may not be any relation between X and Y, and the desired transfer function.&#160; We will use the X and Y values to design the controller.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Desired Response: Specifications and Desired Region</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Any other function that satisfies the three requirements in Slide 4 is also fine.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Desired Response: Specifications and Desired Region</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Because the error is because of unit step input, it can be assumed to be dimensionless.&#160; To see this, if the step is of height 2, we will divide the error by 2 and so on.&#160; Thus, the error e can also be thought of as scaled and hence the two quantities can be compared.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Desired Response: Desired Response: Specifications and Desired Region</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Discrete time approach is more accurate.&#160; To get overshoot, you need to have complex conjugate poles.&#160; This is possible only in our approach.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Desired Response: Specifications and Desired Region</SUBJECT>

&lt;p&gt;2.&#160; For overdamped systems only, we need to consider the change from 10 to 90%.&#160; For underdamped systems, which will give rise to finite rise time, our definition is better.&lt;/p&gt;

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir, we are saying that y(output) is the integral of the input. Is this under the assumption that the transfer function, g(n-k)=1 in the expression we used earlier i.e. y(k)=&#8721;u(k).g(n-k)?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;The integrator, based on its pole and zero, amplifies the 0 frequency and filters out the highest frequency of 180 deg.&#160; So, it is a low pass filter.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Regarding multiple options for discretization</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we have to choose between forward difference/backward difference methods for discretization, it does affect the form of the eventual transfer function. Does the nature of frequency rejection of the eventual transfer function (wrt being a high or a low pass filter) depend upon the choice of the method of discretization/are their any heuristics for deciding which method will give us a high pass or a low pass filter?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Regarding multiple options for discretization</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Only the denominator will be modified by the choice of approximation.&#160; Thus, the rule is very simple, just as we discussed in the slides.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Please post your questions here</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;It is not a question of whether the gain is programmatically or manually changed.&#160; Instead, it is a question of whether the change is given in absolute form or incremental form.&#160; If it is the former, any mistakes in the initial values may affect drastically, while it may not be a serious problem in the case of the latter.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;You talked about the valve example and the concept of bumpless transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we have a case where through calculations we know that the valve is supposed to open 60% but due to information mismatch and use of del(u) the valve opening increased from 40 to 50%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Won't the use of u be better in that case over the use of del(u) ? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can specify the absolute values and the controller will behave accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In slide 13, we are using the trapezoidal approximation to discretise the I mode and we are using the backward difference approximation to discretise the D mode. Even if we use the backward difference approximation for both I and D modes, we shall have offset-free tracking. So, is there any specific reason we are using&#160;two different approaches for approximation in the same equation??&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Cascade Control</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The two situtations are different.&#160; The bumpless controller that I am talking about will remove the bumps that arise out of possible book keeping mistakes while going from one control mode (say manual) to another (say automatic).&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you are talking about has to do with the situation when no mistake in book keeping is made.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Nature of different approximations</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;If you had come to the previous class, you would know the answer, as I explained it in the class.&#160; Please read section 5.4.1 in the book.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 14</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;When you multiply out, you will get a polynomial involving z^2, z and a constant term.&#160; If you multiply throughout by z^{-2}, these terms will respecively become, 1, z^{-1} and z^{-2}, resulting in e(n), e(n-1) and e(n-2).&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should carry out the calculations and check them out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;This is the same as control input or manipulated variable.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: About integral term </SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;This question is not clear.&#160; What error are you talking about - tracking error or measurement error?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Please post your questions here</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;You should have stated the slide number.&#160; My answer would have been slightly different, depending on the slide number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start off by saying that we will give the sudden change in the reference signal only to the integral mode - giving sudden change to the derivative and proportional modes can result in big changes in the error and hence in the control effort.&#160; Thus, the integral mode only comes in the forward path.&#160; The other modes are weighted by a small number in the forward path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportional mode and the derivative mode can be given the plant output, however, as it does not have sudden changes.&#160; Thus, the feedback path can have the proportional and the derivative modes.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: PID controller with filtering slide 20</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I answered the logic for splitting the three modes into forward and feedback paths while answering Ashish Pareek's question.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filtering action on the derivative mode comes when we try to satisfy the tracking condition.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 25</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Yes.&#160; I-PD controller is a full and full feedback controller.&#160; If the plant output is not available, I-PD controller cannot be implemented.&#160; In feed forward controller, however, there is no need at all to measure the plant output.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Please post your questions here</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trapezoidal approximation is more correct than forward or backward approximation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, if you use it in the derivative mode, there are oscillations, as it is a high pass filter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, we go for another implementation, even if it is less approximate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I explained in the last class how the filtering action changes depending on the pole, zero locations.&#160; From your question, I believe that you did not attend it.&#160; You may want to read section 5.4.1 in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no hard and fast rule that tells which approximation is to be used.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 13</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;This simply means that each term is approximated by different quantities.&#160; Each of these terms is multiplied by a tuning parameter, which gets adjusted any way.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Please post your questions here</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;It is because the trapezoidal approximation is more accurate than both the forward and backward versions.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 22, setpoint kick </SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;That is because integration is a smoothing operation.&#160; For example, the area under the curve, even if it has steps, increases as a continuous function!&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Please post your questions here</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Actually, what I have written in the slide is only partially correct, as the bumpless action can be recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for making that statement is that when you multiply the terms on the left hand side, we lose the $$\Delta u$$ form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we recover the bumpless action?&#160; Let $$u_1 = (1+r_1z^{-1})u$$.&#160; Then, the left hand side can be written as $$\Delta u_1$$, which is once again in the difference form!&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 12: Tc=Sc</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;This question was asked in the last class itself and I gave the same following answer:&#160; Normally, we expect Tc to be a lower degree polynomial compared to Sc and hence, this condition may not arise.&#160; For completeness, however, we can include the fourth condition as well.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 15 - bumpless transfer </SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The question is not clear.&#160; You seem to be assuming something else.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide no. 6</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The derivative mode will have the form (z-1)e(n), which will result in e(n+1)-e(n), with us being at time n.&#160; This means that e(n+1), the future error term, will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Please see my answer to Shubham Gupta also.&#160; The jump in the integral term will be a lot slower, as the integral term is a low pass filter!&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 13 Integral and derivative approximations of PID controller</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;What you say is correct: backward difference approximation could have been used for both.&#160; As the trapezoidal approximation is more correct, however, it may be used whenever permissible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the different types of approximations, various "industrial implementations" have resulted!&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: About integral term </SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The difference between desired position and actual position. In the beginning the tracking error is maximum. So if we apply the integration term from the beginning it would create much more large integral term compared to that of proportional and differential. So we can apply itegration of the error after the error has reached below some threshold and not from the beginning&#160;so as to reduce steady state offset.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Please post your questions here</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir, there is one statement "If poles are on real axis then it leads to oscillation, let say at z=-1". I am not clear about this statement.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;open loop delay = k means the change in input now will affect output y(k). When this is fed back to the controller it can incorporate it in u(k+1) which will have an effect on y(k+1) making the closed loop delay= k+1.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;The solution R1 and S1 of Aryabhatta's identity doesn't seem to depend on T1.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;sir, in the design of 2 DOF controller , it is taken that the poles of the feedback controller and the poles of the input tracking filter are the same. why is it required? Is it possible to have different Rc for tracking and feedback control?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>slide 25</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;When we design a continuous time 2 DOF control, generally disturbance rejection requirements will be also given. But in our magnetic ball problem, only the tracking spec is given and the controller is synthesized based on that only. Can we design a controller to satisfy the requirement without using Aryabhattas identity?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 7</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;By S+T=1, I believe that you are talking about the sum of sensitivity and complementary sensitivity functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This equation will continue to hold. &#160;The Sc and Tc that we have used here have nothing to do with S and T of the first para.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 8</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;You may not be able to do this. &#160;Aryabhatta's identity says (a) under what conditions the solution is available (b) what is the degree of each polynomial, etc. &#160;You cannot violate these conditions. &#160;So you may not be able to assign some polynomial as a constant all the time, although it may be possible once in a while. &#160;If this is indeed possible, Aryabhatta's identity will give the same very solution, modulo some constant.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;Why should there be common factors?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 7</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The controller is made up of Rc, Sc and Tc. &#160;These terms in turn depend on Ag and Bg. &#160;If Ag and Bg are outside the unit circle, the controller will become unstable. &#160;Would you want to use unstable controllers, if you can avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 8-9</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should use the least degree solution. &#160;The reason for this is explained in Section 9.6 of the textbook.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Slide 12: Gain perturbation</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;sir&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we apply internal mode priniciple to handle gain perturbation and add an integral to Rc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the limitations of this procedure? how to ensure that conditions for the Aryabhattas' identity to give solutions are maintained?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 12: Gain perturbation</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;There are problems related to satisfying some conditions for low degree polynomials only.&#160; When internal model principle is used (e.g. an integrator, etc., is included), the polynomial degree goes up and the problem some times becomes easier to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no general conditions, however.&#160; I don't see any other limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>slide 4: cancellation of Ab while arriving at the transfer function</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while deriving the transfer function between Y and R we have ensured that should not be any unstable pole zero cancellation for eg R1 should have its roots inside the unit circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but in the process we are also cancelling out Ab which we know has unstable roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can you elaborate as to why this is not leading to an unstable response.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>slide 12: internal model principle as a method to ensure same steady state</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we have used the IMC principle to ensure that irrespective of the perturbations applied on the gain the controller ensures that the output reaches the same steady state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Sir we had read that IMC is a method to ensure internal stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;even without IMC being employed the output is merely reaching a different steady state and not being unstable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can you please say where the stability factor is coming into play.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>slide 17: sluggish response</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;In the slide 17, there is a transfer function which has a pole approximately at -0.9. In the video, how did you conclude that the system will give a sluggish response because of the pole being close to -1 ?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 12: internal model principle as a method to ensure same steady state</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Are you confusing between internal model principle and a control method known as the internal model control?&#160; These two are completely different.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have demonstrated that when the internal model principle is satisfied, the offset can be removed.&#160; Look at slides 7 and 8 in lecture 7.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 4: cancellation of Ab while arriving at the transfer function</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Please note that the two Abs that are getting cancelled are IDENTICAL, as they come from the same source.&#160; In contrast, in slides 5 and 6, the unstable factor R1 is from two different sources, which is not permitted.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 17: sluggish response</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Let us consider a factor of the form E = $$\rho^n$$, with $$0&amp;lt;\rho&amp;lt;1$$.&#160; If $$\rho$$ is close to 0, E will vanish fast.&#160; If on the other hand, it is close 1, E will take for ever to vanish.&#160; So, I say that the second case is sluggish.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;my question is whether we should use &#969; some what higher than the &#969;min come from response specifications. same way for &#961; as well.( choose &#961; less that&#160;&#961;max).&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Re: about &#934;cl</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;What you say is correct.&#160; All we know is that the poles should be in the shaded region.&#160; The boundary values do not work some times, because of the errors in modelling and the loss of performance because of the bad part of B.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revising the conditions does indeed allow us to "inside" this boundary.&#160; For example, compare the values in slides 24 and 35 in the previous lecture, i.e., 11.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;Let us apply that principle in this context.&#160; The basic design had $$R_c=B^gR_1$$, see slide 3.&#160; Now that we want to include $$\Delta$$, the new expression is $$R_c=B^g\Delta R_1$$.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 6</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;$$R_c$$ is in the denominator of the controller.&#160; So if its roots are outside the unit circle, the controller becomes unstable.&#160; What is there to "conceptually" explain?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this slide you mention that we can directly specify &#934;&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt;. Sir, I wanted to know that what would be the case in which we could directly mention it. Obviously, using rise time and other specifications we can find it out, but if we wanted to specify the &#934;&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;directly, what wouldbe the necessary conditions of &#934;&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;(Other than being a stable system with zeros on RHP) ??&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Slide # 3</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Slide 3 you said that Smith Predictor is a strategy to handle plant delays. I did not quite understand how and why we need the predictor to handle the plant delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we run system identification for the plant we would get an estimate of the chracteristic polynomial of the plant and the net delay due to the plant. Hence, we get k, B&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;. We can design our controller appropriately. Why do we need the Smith Predictor?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say that we include one delay to denote minimum unit delay. Are there any heuristics to decide if we need more than one unit delay for a specific problem - as in can a problem be inherently such that the controller designed cannot have just one unit delay, but needs more, in which case we'll have to carry out a different analysis?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 20: Reciprocal polynomials in finding Gq</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;What Jitendra Kumar says is perfectly correct.&#160; Only one clarification: although the negative real part may not affect stability, the performance may be reduced, as we have seen before.&#160; As a result, IMC takes the negative real part also as bad.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 7 - delay compensation</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Let me give an intutitve explanation.&#160; Remember that we have to compare the current output of the plant with the current setpoint and use this error to drive the controller.&#160; But what is meant by the "current" output?&#160; Is it the output "before" you apply the control effort or the output that you get "after" you apply the control effort?&#160; Both of them will happen "simultaneously" when there is absolutely no delay in the loop.&#160; This situation is referred to as the algebraic loop.&#160; When there is no algebraic loop, it will be possible to distinguish between before and after.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 3 about &#966;cl</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;It is ok to say this.&#160; But comparison with a first order system is more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;Who says that this problem will go away if noise or plant model mismatch is introduced?&#160; These are two orthogonal issues.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: system delay</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;In discrete time systems, the delay can change only in integral numbers of the sampling period.&#160; Naturally, the control system should be capable of handling such changes.&#160; Robust control design techniques, such as QFT and $$H^\infty$, can possibly be used in such situations.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Please state the slide number and ask your question</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;You should state the slide number on the Subject Heading.&#160; This will help locate your question easily in the class.&#160; Can you please edit your subject title now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to your question is in Slide 9.&#160; This choice results in $$\hat y$$ being equal to the delay-free version of the plant output when we have a perfect knowledge of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Please state the slide number and ask your question</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Please see my answer to Aniket Deb.&#160; His post has "Slide 7" in the subject heading.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 7</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;It is not correct to say that delay compensation prevents algebraic loops.&#160; I don't think that I said that in the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delay compensation is used to get better control performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algebraic loops are introduced when there is no delay (not even one unit sample delay) in the loop.&#160; I have explained the problems created by this in the post by Aniket with "Slide 7" in the subject heading.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 4 - Effect of plant delay</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;In order to compare the results of Astrom's book, I used their example directly.&#160; If there is no overshoot, we cannot discuss rise time as the way we have defined, because a second order underdamped system is required for overshoot and oscillations.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrom has not followed our approach.&#160; If we define 90% of the time to reach the final value as the rise time, we can arrive at an interpretation of what Astrom has used.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 20: Reciprocal polynomials in finding Gq- class discussion</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;If the inverse of the plant model is not stable, we need to find the best approximate to use IMC. Hence the reciprocal polynomials are used. This is an optimization problem.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 7 - delay compensation - class discussion</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;System won't be physically meaning ful if everything happens instantaneously. At least one sample delay is there in every sampled data system. Xcos or Simulink assume minimum delay while solving the equations, other wise simulation shows error as algebraic loops.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: IMC design  - class discussion</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The factoring method followed in IMC design is a from an optimization solution.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see this approach in pol placement controllers and use reciprocal polynomials to avoid B&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;While answering a particular question (in the video), you said that C.&#958;(n) is &lt;strong&gt;the filtered white noise&lt;/strong&gt;. We know that C is also the &lt;strong&gt;moving average term&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please explain how are these two related.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>slide 8 and 10: minimizing variance of u(n)</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>Sir,
For GPC it is mentioned that it's not possible to constrain the values of u(n) but only its changes. By the same logic, we should be minimizing variance of delta of u(n) in GMVC method as well.</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>slide 20: Determination of N</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we saw in the example where we calculated the pre-multipllier matrix G to be a square matrix (taking N = 3), can we not do this every time, namely choose an N such that G is square? Will there be cases where this is not possible?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>slide 8: Regulation Problem</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the regulation problem, we have a different function to be minimized as opposed to the servo problem. But since we would like a single controller to be able to tackle both the problems, how do we obtain a transfer function for the same?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;&#916;*u =(1-Z&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)*u= u(n)-u(n-1)= &#916;u&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUBJECT>Re: slide no 7: about Minimum variance control</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;What you say is correct, but this is an extreme situation.&#160; In any case, the minimum variance control does not have any facility to reduce the control effort.&#160; It is not the question of which model to use - model choice is decided by other considerations.&#160; But once a model is given, one has to select the control technique to use.&#160; As minimum variance control has a problem, you have to try other methods.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide No 8: is MVC and GPC are to find optimisation goal functions for controllers</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;MVC is used as a reference.&#160; No controller can get a better performance.&#160; Unfortunately, however, MVC cannot be used in real practise.&#160; All controller performance is generally compared with that of MVC.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 3: ARMAX vs ARIMAX</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;It depends on whether the noise is "random" or whether it has random "steps".&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 7: GPC vs LQG</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;These are rigorous, because these do not make the approximation that GMVC makes.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In LQG there is only one model that is used.&#160; For example, fix the model, calculate the control law and apply it.&#160; In GPC, it is possible to change the model with time, based on recently obtained data.&#160; The model predictive controllers are said to be effective when plant varies with time.&#160; If the model does not vary much and if you want to minimise the calculations, you should go for LQG.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 5: Filtered White Noise</SUBJECT>

        <SUBJECT>Re: slide no. 10</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;People have used N values as large as 500.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARMAX or ARIMAX will depend on whether or not the noise has random steps.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 8 and 10: minimizing variance of u(n)</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Yes, what you say is correct.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 20: Determination of N</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, G will be a tall matrix.&#160; Let us see how.&#160; What does N depend on?&#160; It depends on the time over which the model has an effect.&#160; The model may have only a few parameters, but may affect the output for long times.&#160; It follows that G will be tall.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;GMVC is easy to design and use, although approximate.&#160; It is used by the Japanese in self tuning controllers, for example.&#160; But this controller is only approximate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have given a comparison of GPC vs. LQG in another question, asked by Lalwani Aditya Ajit.&#160; Please see it.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide no 7: about Minimum variance control - class discussion</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;There is no control problem where the cost of control effort is not a concern. MVC may demand large control effort such that the controller is not implementable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example: assume an air conditioning system where the set point temperature has to be achieved quickly, the control effort may demand the application of 1 million ton cold air within 1ns - which will be prohibitive, cost wise. MVC is not a suitble choice for such requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide No 8: is MVC and GPC are to find optimisation goal functions for controllers - class discussion</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;MVC contollers are not used in a plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPC based controllers will be discussed in subsequent classes.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 7: GPC vs LQG - class discussion</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The approximate method used to find solution for GMVC is to to differentiate the argument of the expectation (operator) withe respect to u(n). Such approximations are not used GPC ,LQG hence they are more accurate&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 10 Value of N - class discussion</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;A y = B u ................(1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;y = B/A u .................(2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two expressions are equivalent. However in eqn (2) long division of B by A can result in large no: of terms. For system identification requirements eqn(2) is better though computational requirements are high.The no:of terms is a trade off between accuracy and computational constraints. Similar logic is applied in selecting N value for GPC. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

Is it possible to comment on bounded nature of &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt; from this expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if it is unstable which is tuning parameter here which helps us to make &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt; stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also explain how it is stabilised&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>slide 7 and 9</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir, column vector &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; contains future values of reference and how are you going to predict future values of input unless it is a regulator problem?

&lt;p&gt;the plant model. Is manual intervention required?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide no 8: control effort stability</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;This is identical to the situation where the control effort is available for free - recall the room cooling example that I gave in the last class.&#160; Naturally, the control effort can go unbounded.&#160; The solution is to bound the control effort as well.&#160; A way to overcome this difficulty is given in slide 10.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 7 and 9</SUBJECT>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The difference between actual measurement of the output, namely y and the model predicted value $$\hat y$$ is known as the bias here.&#160; We assume the bias to be the same for all future time instants in DMC.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 9</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Fat matrix of G is equivalent to fitting more number of parameters using less number of data points.&#160; An example of this situation is to give only two points and to try to fit a sine curve through it.&#160; In contrast, a tall matrix of G is equivalent to fitting a straight line through three or more points.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>slide 19: Reducing computing time</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you have said, for deriving the GPC control law, we just need the first row of the matrix equation. In case that we have our system re-identified every now and then as you have suggested in some cases, isn't there a way to just implement the first row of the matrix equation in our scilab code so that we don't have to compute the rest of the rows unnecessarily each time? Also is there a way to avoid inversion of what would probably be a large matrix every time to obtain K?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>slide 32: Model for the bias</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;since we have a model for the error in some previous lectures as e(n) = &#961;^n*(wn), can we try using a similar model for modeling the bias in our expression instead of letting it be constant for all control moves?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 17  re estimating the model</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Yes, u(n+1) is never used, although it is calculated at every time instant.&#160; Same thing happens for u(n+2), u(n+3), etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the future control moves are never used, they still need to be calculated.&#160; Although they are never used, they influence the calculation of u(n) itself, tempering it, as it were.&#160; As a result, even though the future control moves are not used directly, their indirect use is of great significance.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Use of the bias term</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The GPC approach has a rigorous noise model.&#160; It will make more sense to re-calculate the model parameters also, at every time step, or whenever possible/required.&#160; This is because the bias term approach is just a "fix", involving a crude approximation that the bias term remains constant throughout the future.&#160; Such an approximation is required only when other options don't exist, for example in DMC, where the noise is not even modelled.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Detrmination of Control Horizon</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The control horizon and also the prediction horizon are tuning parameters in all MPC.&#160; Control horizon is smaller than the prediction horizon.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: 16th lecture: slide 18 </SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;It is selected by trial and error.&#160; Based on the domain knowledge and past experience, one comes up with an initial value of $$\rho$$.&#160; If the resulting control effort is unacceptably large, increase $$\rho$$ and re-calculate the control law.&#160; If the control is ineffective, however, and if the control effort can be increased, decrease $$\rho$$ instead.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 9 : least square problem</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;In the equation Gu = b+e, we want to calculate u such that e is made zero.&#160; In other words, we want to solve Gu=b.&#160; As this is not a square system, there is no solution in strict sense.&#160; One option is to invoke the least squares approach.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 3: Ny &gt; Nu</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;This can be explained with a simple example.&#160; Suppose that the control effort has to be changed by a constant value, i.e. a step change.&#160; Suppose also that the control effort remains constant thereafter.&#160; Depending on the settling time of the system, this control change will influence the output value for a long time.&#160; Ny should be large enough to capture all these changes.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 19: Reducing computing time</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;You have two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we calculate u at just one time instant?&#160; The answer is no.&#160; Please see the answer that I gave to Sudeesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we avoid calculating the inverse at every time instant?&#160; The answer is "Yes".&#160; This method is called recursive least squares.&#160; This involves "adjusting" the solution calculated in the last time step, based on the changes in the G matrix, in the equation Gu = b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it should be understood that one never "inverts" any matrix in the calculation of K.&#160; One just solves it by Gaussian elimination or similar methods.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 32: Model for the bias</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;No, we cannot do that.&#160; The model that you have proposed will work only for deterministic systems.&#160; It will not work when one of the elements is noise, which changes randomly.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;All poles cannot be placed arbitrarily.&#160; There will be some poles called "controllable poles", which can be placed at desired locations.&#160; We cannot change the location of other poles.&#160; If these poles are stable, i.e. inside the unit circle, the response due to them will decay asymptotically.&#160; This is the best we can hope for.&#160; In case these "uncontrollable" poles are also unstable, we can do nothing about this system, which will necessarily become unstable.&#160; The only way to handle this situation is by changing the system itself (e.g. including a new control variable, etc.) and modifying the C matrix.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Slide 21: Subtracting infinities</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have said that if the eigenvectors of A are outside the unit circle, e(m) will be a difference of two terms that both individually tend to infinity. How are we then deducing that their difference tends to infinity as well? For instance, if e(m) is a difference of f(x+1) -f(x), where f(x) = x, f tends to infinity for both terms as x and x+1 both tend to infinity, but the difference remains constant. Is there something more that allows us to definitely say that the error is blowing up?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 21: Subtracting infinities</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I could have given a better explanation in the slide.&#160; We can write the equation for e(m+1) as follows: $$e(m) = A^m e(0) + \cdots$$.&#160; As $$A$$ has eigen values outside the unit circle, $$e$$ will be unbounded if $$e(0) \neq 0$$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also note that $$e(0)$$ will necessarily have to be nonzero.&#160; If it is zero, it would imply that we know the initial state exactly, using which we can calculate all the future states "exactly".&#160; We are building an estimator precisely because we do not know the states "exactly".&#160; In other words, we do not know the initial state and hence $$e(0)$$ will necessarily have to be nonzero.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Re: 18th lecture: mention the slide number and ask your question</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;These two characteristic polynomials are independent.&#160; The guideline we use is that we make the estimator a lot faster than the controller.&#160; For this, we make the poles of the estimator to be closer to the origin of the Z-plane.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide No.13</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;What you say is correct - the answer will be the same no matter what order you choose for multiplication.&#160; But depending on the sequence of computation, the required effort may be more or less.&#160; For example, because of the order I have chosen, the numbers 3 and -2 do not participate in the calculation at all, thereby reducing the computational effort!&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 21: Desired characteristics of error</SUBJECT>

        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;A good question.&#160; If the states are unbounded, how can we estimate them?&#160; We can build a meaningful estimator only when what it tries to estimate is bounded.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <SUBJECT>Re: slide no 9: controller order</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sorry if I made a mistake.&#160; Order of A - number of states measured in y should be equal to the order of the reduced order ESTIMATOR.&#160; For example, if all the states are measured, there is no need to estimate anything and the order of the reduced order estimator is zero.&#160; In a n state system the order of the reduced order estimator is n-m when m states are measured.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 30 - equivalent response using polynomial approach</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Remember that we used a dead-beat estimator that gives the exact value immediately.&#160; So there is no approximation in the state space approach also.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide no. 4,5</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I believe that you missed previous classes.&#160; Initial Xbar is left to the user.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 12: Comparison of output equation and state equation</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The correspondence is between what is estimated and what is measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the full order estimator, all the states are estimated and y is the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the reduced order estimator, what is not measured is estimated (xb) and a function of measured states (xa) is the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correspondence is between (1) estimator equations and (2) output equations.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide number 30</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;We arrive at the polynomial approach for a particular choice (dead-beat) of estimator.&#160; For other choices, you will get different compensators.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re:slide 22</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;When the poles of the estimator are chosen to be at the origin.&#160; The response is of the form $$e=a^n$$, where $$e$$ is the error, $$a$$ is the pole location and $$n$$ is the sampling instant.&#160; The time taken for $$e$$ to reach zero is nil.&#160; This provides the fastest response possible.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an example of dead beat controller in the book.&#160; Please read it.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: 19th lecture:slide 5</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I believe that you missed the previous class, where we discussed it at length.&#160; Xbar is chosen to be arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 22: Deadbeat Estimator</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The word deadbeat came from the controller design.&#160; A deadbeat controller is one that follows the setpoint exactly and immediately.&#160; For the controller to behave like this, we need the controller to be the fastest, which mathematically translates into the poles of the controller being at the origin - please see the book for an example of a deadbeat controller.&#160; The same logic is used in the coining of this term for the estimator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadbeat estimator may be susceptible to noise, just as the output feedback controller is.&#160; On the other hand, it is possible to smoothen the measurement by properly designing an estimator.&#160; An optimally designed estimator is called the Kalman Filter.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 5: xbar and x</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The poles of the estimator decide how fast we converge to the actual value.&#160; As metnioned in the previous class, we have no facility to choose the initial estimate - domain knowledge is required.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 11</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;You will have to come up with the correspondence equation once again for the new scenario.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 6</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;For the estimator block, y is the input and the estimated state is the output.&#160; Of course,&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide no.22</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Why?&#160; In general, both entries in B can change.&#160; Please see Slide 17 in the second lecture.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide no.15</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Can you please derive using your simplified approach and offer it to the class?&#160; It will be an improvement over Ogata's approach.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 9 : Controller order</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Because of the presence of A matrix in the explression for $$G_c$$, its order will always be equal to the dimension of A.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>slide 29: identical controllers</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got identical controllers from polynomial and estimator methods. &#160;If we chose a different estimator, do we get different controllers?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please remember to include the slide number in the subject heading - please also provide a brief description of your question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>slide 7</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;How did you obtain the model for queue&#160; system?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Slide 3 - Integral Action</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.4;"&gt;As we are calling it 'Integral Action', where is the integration involved?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Slide 15: Value of &#955;(N)</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;x(N+1) =0 and we have assumed u(N) = 0. The state equation then implies that x(N) =0. This in turn will imply&#160;&#955;(N) = Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;x(N) =&#160;0 and henceforth, which should not be the case. What am I missing here?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>slide 21</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;sir, gain matirx K suddently appears in slide 21 which was not used in the earlier fomulations. kindly explain&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>slide 3: integeral action</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;dear sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why are we calling X&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;(k+1)=X&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;(k)+e(k) as integeral action?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;please ellaborate.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 11</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Why only x1 has to be made zero and no constrainet on x2 ?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Slide 8: Pole placements</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If given a choice, which poles should be placed nearer to the origin: for x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or for x&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Slide 3: Integral action</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;How can we say that x&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; incorporates integral action?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>slide 10: dead beat controller</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the example we discussed in the video, if poles are chosen at the origin ,the final r value is obtained in n (3) steps. But for the problem 14.7 (mentioned in the video) &#160;this is not seen. Should we take a different value of 'c' matrix for this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>slide 8 : form of the A-BK system</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the A-BK form we have a matrix consisting of A and -C since A &amp;amp; C are matrices themselves can you please say what will the form of this characteristic equation&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>slide 39 : control hamiltonian matrix</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what is the logic/rationale behind constructing the control hamiltonian matrix ?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 7</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I have taken it from a book that explains the advantages of using feedback control in computing systems.&#160; The reference is given in the text.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 3 - Integral Action</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;There are two ways of looking at the equation $$x_I(k+1)=x_I(k) + e(k)$$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At steady state, the state instant k+1 is equal to the state at k and hence, the error term e becomes zero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you write this recursively, you will see the error adding up, just as it happens in integral mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 15: Value of &#955;(N)</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;What we are trying to convey is that the control is so effective that after N moves, we can make the control effort zero.&#160; Possibly, I could have said the following:&#160; Demand u(N) = 0, else x(N+1) is not negligibly small.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 21</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;It comes from the definition of control law, namely, u = - Kx.&#160; As this form is a standard one, it is not explicitly stated here, although I could have done that.&#160; Please see the second last equation on slide 17.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 3: integeral action</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Please see the answer I have given to Pranavkumar.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 8: Pole placements</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The dynamical equation whose solution should fast converge should have its eigenvalue or pole close to the origin.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 3: Integral action</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;See the reply that I have given to Pranavkumar.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 10: dead beat controller</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;The number of steps to converge to zero is n or less.&#160; Do you need more than n steps in example 14.7?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 8 : form of the A-BK system</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;It is obtained by taking determinant.&#160; Please see slide 3 in lecture 17.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 39 : control hamiltonian matrix</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Two point BVP (boundary value problem) in the finite time case and an iterative calculation in the infinite time case get converted into an eigenvalue problem, which is easier to solve.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: Slide 3 - Integral Action</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;So it will be X&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;(k+1)=e(k)+e(k-1)+e(k-2)+....+e(0)+X&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;(0)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we choose the value of X&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;(0)?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Re: slide 10: dead beat controller</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I had tried with c = [1 1 0] earlier, which didn't converge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.4;"&gt;No of steps to converge is exactly n with c = [1 1 1]. &#160;Does it imply that c matrix has to have this value always?&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
        <SUBJECT>Slide 10</SUBJECT>
        <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;What if we want the states to go to a non zero value?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>
